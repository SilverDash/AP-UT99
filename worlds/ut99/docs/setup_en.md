# Unreal Tournament Setup Guide

## Installation

### Game

* Direct Download https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unrealtournament/full-game-installers/ 

* Yes the game is free to download! **ONLY** from this website. See reason below. 


While the game released in 1999 and was sold both online and in retail stores for years to come, the game was removed for unknown reasons.

In 2020 Epic delisted Unreal Tournament from all online stores causing the community to be unable to access this classic shooter.

Luckily a group of developers that were granted access to Unreal Engine 1 source to develop patches since 2016
was given Legal rights to distribute the Game and its patches along with rights to continue development.

You can find a link to the Game's Installer from the [OldUnreal](https://oldunreal.com/) website.

This will install the game along with all the original bonus packs released and a community patch.
The version of the patch is still updated today, and you **_will_**  be required to update your game in order
to play with Archipelago.

### Install Archipelago Mod
_It's recommended to install a separate Version of Unreal Tournament to use with Archipelago as the mod will prevent you from playing
online due to technical reasons._

First run the game to set up your options and keybinds then close the game.

Download the Archipelago mod zip from the GitHub page:

[Archipelago Mod Download](https://github.com/SilverDash/UT99-AP-MOD/releases/latest)

Then, go to your Unreal Tournament installation directory.
You should see a bunch of folders, Maps, Sounds, System, etc.

Unzip the contents of the mod into the base Unreal Tournament Directory. 
If it asks you to replace files make sure to allow it, this shouldn't affect your saved user settings.

Then you will want to open up the game and confirm you have an Archipelago tab on the top bar.



### Configure Archipelago Mod

In the Main menu, select Archipelago. Under the Archipelago drop down, you will see the options button. 
This will open a configuration window for *Server*,
*Port*, *Slot*, and *Password* where you can fill in the relevant information.

This information can change at any time in the case a port changes.

## Configuring your YAML File

### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
You can see the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn
about why Archipelago uses YAML files and what they're for.
Please note that Unreal Tournament only allows you to type certain characters for your slot name.
These characters are: `` !#$%&'()+,-.0123456789;=@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{}~<>|\/``

### Where do I get a YAML?
You can use the [game options page for Unreal Tournament](/games/Unreal Tournament/player-options) here on the Archipelago website to
generate a YAML using a graphical interface.
