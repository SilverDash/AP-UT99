# Unreal Tournament

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Unreal Tournament is an arena shooter developed by Epic Mega Games in 1999.
In the vanilla game you would be loading into maps and winning the game by reaching the goal
scores for that map. Eventually fighting the champion XAN in a 1v1 on his personal ship.

For Archipelago this means you'll be winning matches and picking up randomly spawned items
to gain checks on each map.

Progressive unlocks can be enabled to make your game more interesting.
Weapons, armor, Bot AI and even your ladder unlocks. 

If traps are enabled, some randomized negative effects can affect your game when found.


## What is the goal of Unreal Tournament?

The vanilla goal of Unreal Tournament is to beat all the ladders fully to unlock the final set of challenges.
4 maps the final being the 1 on 1 with Xan. Beat Xan to win the game.

## What Unreal Tournament items can appear in other players' worlds?

Positive rewards can be:

* `Health`
* `Armor`
* `Ammo`
* `Relics`
* `Miscellaneous Other Goodies`

Traps consist of handcrafted events. Examples include:

* `Slow Player`
* `Monster Ambush`
* `Temparary Bot Skill increase`
* `And Many More*`

_*the list will be updated based on feedback_

## How many location checks are there?

The standard vanilla game has you going through the ladders in a specific order:

* DeathMatch - 14 maps
* Domination - 10 maps
* Capture The Flag - 10 maps
* Assault - 7 maps
* Challenge - 4 maps

The GOTY version of the game adds some extra maps if enabled:

* DeathMatch - 16 maps
* Domination - 10 maps
* Capture The Flag - 12 maps
* Assault - 7 maps
* Challenge - 4 maps

So about 40 checks in Vanilla and 48 checks in GOTY. 5 of those maps are the Tutorial maps and the final one is the Win Condition

_Tutorial maps are not required but offer a way for new players to get a grasp of 
what each gamemode requires you to do to win._

Adding 3 - 6 items per map would mean: 
* 120 - 240 in Vanilla and 144 - 288 in GOTY checks total.

But you can Set the limit for each ladder up to 20 from the Minimum you see up above.

Assuming you set all the max you would see a wopping:

* 300 - 600 Checks. 

 You can also add 3 Extra ladders along with TeamDeathMatch amounting to:

* 480 - 960 Checks. 




## What does another world's item look like in Unreal Tournament?

Archipelago Items will always show up as an Archipelago Logo as a 3D model.

## Is Archipelago compatible with other Unreal Tournament mods?

Yes, most other Unreal Tournament mods *should* work. However, most have not been tested.
Depending on the settings you choose, maps you install that support bot pathing can be 
selected to be a map in the ladder.

Mutators are not supported currently.
